# Self Assessment

### __Functionality:__
#### *3: Meets Expectations*
* Enigma class encrypt and decrypt methods are implemented
* Running of the encrypt.rb and decrypt.rb were successful

### __Object Oriented Programming:__
#### *3: Meets Expectations*
* There are 4 classes: Generator, Shift, Rotator, and Enigma

* Generator generates the random numbers

* Shift is responsible for creating the actual final shift amounts

* Rotator has the character map and brings in the shift values to
* result in the rotated alphabet and associated shift amounts

* Enigma pulls in all the classes to one place to call the encrypted and
* decrypted messages

* There is one method in Shift (keys(random_number)) that is longer
* than 7 lines. No classes are longer than
* 100 lines

* Variable names clearly communicate purpose:
* example: letter_conversion(character, index, shift_amounts, direction)
* example: randomizer
### __Test Driven Development:__
#### *3: Meets Expectations*
* Test coverage is 100%, Rakefile implemented
* git history shows tests written before code

### __Version Control:__
#### *3: Meets Expectations*
* More than 30 commits
* More than 15 pull requests
* No more than three commits have multiple pieces of functionality,
* from my understanding
